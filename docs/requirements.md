# Documents the project requirements

## Functional requirements

Main requirements:
- The Demo example works well without eny errors
- Other examples can work with WARN-messages and not-implementation exceptions

The Demo example:

1. Start a benchmark for the tested service with version 1.0.0 and get the profiling results
2. Start a benchmark for the tested service with version 2.0.0 and get the profiling results
3. Get the difference between the profiling results
4. Get the difference between versions 1.0.0 and version 2.0.0
5. Get correlations between profiling results diffs and the source code diffs

## Non-functional requirements


## Technical specifications

- Java 21
- Gradlew
- GitHub Actions
- Semantic Versioning (SemVer) and conventional commits

## Constraints and limitations

Solutions should be written in Java and should be as simple as possible.
